# Release Notes

## v2.0.0 - April 1st, 2025
Features:

- The PingOne MFA SDK has been updated to allow the same device to be paired in multiple geographic regions.
- The SDK now has a method called `testRemoteNotification` that allows you to test and debug push notification functionality.
- A new mandatory method called `configure` has been added. This method is used to set up the SDK.
- The following methods have been deprecated: `getInfo`, `generateMobilePayload`.
- The method `setDeviceToken` was updated to return an array of errors.
- Cancel Authentication feature added: lets PingOne server send a new notification with `authCanceled` notification type, to the userâ€™s device if they switch to a different device during the authentication process. This notification type tells the app that the authentication was canceled, so the app can remove any pop-up without waiting for a timeout, ensuring a smoother user experience.
- Number Matching feature added: This is an enhanced authentication method where a number is displayed on the web interface, and the user must input the same number on their mobile device after receiving a push notification, with parameter `numberPicked`, in the `NotificationObject.approve()` method. This ensures that the user controls both devices, adding an extra layer of security to prevent accidental or unauthorized approvals.

Known issue:
- If your app enables obfuscation, you need to add specific ProGuard rules to prevent re-obfuscation of the PingOne MFA SDK. Failure to do so may cause unexpected behavior or malfunctions in certain library features.
  To avoid issues, add the following rules to your ProGuard rules file:
```gradle
# Prevent re-obfuscation of the PingOne MFA SDK classes.
-keep class com.pingidentity.pingidsdkv2.** {*;}
-keep class com.pingidentity.pingonemfa.** {*;}
```
Ensure your app's ProGuard configuration includes these rules before building a release.
